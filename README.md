# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

Using Plotly, we created a dashboard for Rosa to visualize data collected for the Belly Button Biodiversity experiment. With the dashboard, we can search by the volunteer's ID number to obtain a chart of their demographics, a bar chart describing the ten most prominent flora present, a bubble chart of all bacteria identified, and a scrub meter of how often belly button washes were reported.

Further analysis is suggested. It may be interesting to separate data by geographical location as the United States varies in climate and environment from state to state.
